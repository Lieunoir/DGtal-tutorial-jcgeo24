# DGTal tutorial

Do NOT use this project as a base for a DGtal project, as it is currently tracking a personnal versino of the DGtal project with some work in progress which we'll use

This is largely based on https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal-Tutorials-DGMM2022/tree/main

## Project setup

We setup in Release mode otherwise some parts will be running way too slow

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```
